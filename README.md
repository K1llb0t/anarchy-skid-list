# Noobs
travis - the best to ever do it

Gerald0mc - Use to be a skid (FloatUtils go hard) but is now a professional at north korean code. 

Listed - Semi skidder/Scuffed at custom code & big ego but is ""baiting"".

kyv3/Ligmaballz - Lord of GitHub copilot & north korean coder.

NotRocky/master7720 - Pro mcmod.info editor.

Gentleman - Pro Phobos editor/We need GentleHook v3 :pray:.

Alfie - Lord & savior of OyVey.

ProfKambing - (Unironically 12 yr) That loves to rename strings & act like a scary dark web hacker.

SSLWasTaken - Pro kami5/Phobos editor/Renamer.

\_Fxcte - Pro at OyVey editing.

KuroHere - 30 clients into 1 with KuroHack.

Luscius - Fetish for wurst+2.

Noatmc - Another north korean coder (He's actually learning & improving tho unlike everyone else).

Vaimok - (Unironically) Can't even make/Use a Boolean.

BigJMuffin - OyVey fetish.

pauI - "pro" Java "dev" (Doesn't even know what a "Short" is).

Primooctopus33 - Claims OctoHack's "good" modules are custom then instantly once it's leaked admits it's all skidded (Definition of sad wants to look like a cool coder/hacker).

Wolfsurge - Devs one of the worst clients to ever exist. North korean coder. Claims to credit people if he uses their code, but skidded LiquidBounce's custom font renderer (which is under GPL-3.0 btw). Unironically renders his text by calling the method for each letter. Gets bullied at school (not bait).

HausemasterIssue - Can't make 1 line of custom code & 50 clients into 1 with SpiderSense. Is one of the stupidest people to own a keyboard and cannot code for shit. Also hates Future cause 0x banned him or some shit.

zPrestige_ - Mega OyVey fetish & his prestige base is so bad my god. Doesn't know how to use GL_SCISSOR lel.

2b2tbuilder/DerpyJibs - Femboy & north korean coder.

ObsidianBreaker/accessmodifier364 - Fetish for wurst+2 (This was awhile ago though, so he might actually be able to code now).

Catuquei - OyVey Fetish. (Starting to see a pattern with pvpers and them ~~skidding and pasting into an oyvey base~~ "coding" new clients).

0x22 - Pasted his entire client "Future" from Exeter. It seems he has become a much better developer now, but his client still contains uses old ass Exeter code that he refuses to rewrite. (just look at the gui ðŸ’€) He also buys exploits to put into Future.

Hqrion - Got recognition for making the leaked 1.7.2 phobos buildable. Turns out, it was completely done by his friend Ciruu, and the "SRC" was crashing useless garbage. Kills any project he touches.

Ciruu - Made quite possible the most skidded kami skid to ever exist, "Zispanos Backdoor" back in the day. Now he spends his time on his exit scam, "Abyss" and pasting phobos and summit.

Sjnez - OyVey/Phobos fetish, Skidded just about any client in order to make "Renosense". Pasted salhack PacketEvent and event bus for one module even though his phobos base already had one ðŸ’€.

Es0teric - Oyvey/Phobos paster, made Gondal.club

SirMeme - The single most retarded skid to ever touch intelij. Renamed varius public clients to "FutureX" and tried to sell them. He joined various discords to promote his dogshit.

Novola/Trental - Somehow convinced Gopro to make oyvey buildable (a god awful decision). Then they proceeded to make the original oyvey paste called "Zori" that started this horrible trend.

RageMachine/ManOnTheMoon - Retarded wannabe developer (yet refuses to properly learn to code). Created a paste straight from hell called "synapse", Sold it, pulled a pyro, and then faked various real-life crises as excuses for leaving the project. (There were no refunds).

Hollow - Incel that seems to somewhat know Java, yet their client "Trollgod" is worthless, phobos-pasted garbage.

Chardn0l - Reps trollgod like its the best client, deep throats hollows dong, and larps about being a gangster, even though we all know he's a skinny white incel that gets bullied at school.

p4nda - Beaner 13 year old who made about half a dozen clients which are dogshit gamesense/osiris pastes. Known for "making" the laughably bad shader chams that every client has now.

GL_DONT_CARE - Steals Future code for a living, any code that he "writes" is dogshit and breaks his client (keep this man far away from new konas base, let auto rewrite that shit). Doxes people who crack his client. Spams chat with unfunny memes and cannot win an arguement if his life depended on it.

iBikky - Australian who pastes oyvey for a living, say that his coords exploit is powerful and shit when its actually a dogshit Command.sendMessage from OyVey, paste github's bowbomb and said that he never paste shit. 

K1llb0t_ / Eternity.cc  - :trollface:
